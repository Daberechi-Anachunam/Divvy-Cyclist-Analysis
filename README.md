# Divvy-Cyclist-Analysis
#  INTRODUCTION
   Cyclistic, is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. Cyclistic offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike.
Cyclistic provides flexibility of its pricing plans in order to appeal to the broad consumer segments. Single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. The finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders so the head of marketing has decided that maximizing higher annual membership would be more profitable and better for the overall companies’ growth. 
The Business task of this project would be to find ways to make the Cyclistic subscriptions more profitable, the specific task would be to find the difference in patterns and trends between the members and casual riders in order for better targeted marketing that would drive greater membership subscriptions.
In this project, I will be analysing the data for the bike share company found in [this link.](http://www.divvybikes.com/data). <br>
The anaalysis covered a one year period from july 2021 to june 2022

#  DATA STRUCTURE
The cleaned Cyclistic data set has 4612376 rows and 10 columns. The data ranges from july 2021 to june 2022. This shows the data set is huge and recent which means credible insights can be generayed from them. The data has different data types which include: <br>
** floats:** travel_distance<br>
** int64:** travel_time<br>
** object:** ride_id, rideable_type, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual<br>
** category:** hours, day_of_week, month<br>

There are a total of 2628202 member ride trips and 1984174 casual ride trips

# CONCLUSION
1. Members rent the bikes more but the casual riders use them longer after renting which explains why member riders drive more profit.
2. Casual riders rent the bikes more during the weekends probably for leisure while members rent more during weekdays.
3. There are more rents mid year which is close to holidays and least rents during the ending of the year close to the winter season.The casual riders also rent more than member riders during midyear months unlike other months which hints they rent more for leisure usage.
4. The street is the msot popualr starting point for casual rides.
Only casual riders use docked bikes.
# Key Insights
1. The top 10 start stations and especially the top start station for casual riders(Street Dr and Grand Avenue) would be a strategic area for adverts to changing for converting their casual riders to members.
2. Since Casual riders have more travel time, the possibility of having extra benefits for longer rides available for members only would make registering for membership more enticing for casual riders.
3. Marketing should be increased on weekends and should include the interest of people ride for leisure as they are probably an important part of casual riders.
